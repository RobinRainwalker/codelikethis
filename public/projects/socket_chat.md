# Socket Chat

This project relies on [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) which is a Node library that provides real-time asynchronous publish-and-subscribe messaging using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). 

1. Follow this tutorial to get a chat client *and server* running on your own computer: <https://socket.io/get-started/chat/>
2. Use GitHub to share your code with your lab partner and have them connect *from* their computer *to* your computer
3. Use Heroku to launch the server on the cloud, and connect to it and chat between your computer and your lab partner's computer
4. Pick one of the "homework" features from the bottom of the page and implement it
5. Repeat step 4!
